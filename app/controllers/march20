Grassy Pro 1: 
Stand: equality all are equal so 2 people should formalize their relationship whether.  
Argument: 1:25

Khoi: I think it's wrong because same sex marriage is taboo. because in some country tradition a couple must be man and woman to increase population. biological. cannot be increased.

2: we like God decided what your gender is. so that u cannot change it. 2:05

Nghi: 1 cannot increase population. There are many ways to increase the population. We can make test tube baby. 

2: You can tell someone to surrogate mother

2 marriage for man and woman. I think gender you can change. Can choose to live your life. 

My:
The don't want to do.
